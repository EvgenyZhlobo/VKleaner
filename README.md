# VKleaner
VKleaner is a tool for vk.com than hides unwanted post from news feed.

Do you have problem with reading your personal news feed on vk.com like me? I don't want to read trash from groups and public pages I'm not subsribed. I don't want to view posts with links on QA-sites such as formspring.com, ask.fm and others. VKleaner is nice tool that can hide posts given types and save you time.

**VKleaner can:**

- hide reposts by frends from group you're not subsribed.
- hide posts with links on different sites.
- hide posts containig videos and musics.
- hide sharing of groups.


If you're afraid to miss very important content you can blur messages rather than deleting it from feed.

VKleaner is an open source tool and you're welcome to contribute.
